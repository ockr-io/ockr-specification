\section{Motivation}

Most of the documents today are created in a digital form and are shared online. 
The file itself serves as a vehicle for the actual information. File hashes are often used to prove the authenticity of the information.
However, the file hash can be changed over time, while the information remains the same. Compression techniques are used behind the scenes
while sharing the files online, as well as storing the file in cloud environments. Finally printing the file and scanning it again will result in a different file hash.
Images or documents that store the information in images are not machine readable. While process automation became crutual in many industries,
many processes still rely on manual work because of the lack of machine readable documents. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a technique that
can be used to extract the information from images, but it is not reliable enough to be used in critical processes as 
it can not guarantee the authenticity of the information. Ockr aims to solve these problems by providing a standard for creating machine-readable and reliable information.
