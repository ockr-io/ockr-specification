\section{Abstract}

Ockr aims to set a standard for creating machine-readable and reliable documents, 
enabling the verification of their authenticity. In short Ockr tries to tackle 
three problems:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How can we make sure that a document is machine-readable?
    \item How can we ensure that a document has not been modified?
    \item How can we ensure that a document really has been issued by a certain authority?
\end{enumerate}
